# Data-Analyst-Internship-Spotlight-Pharma-Data-Analysis-Project
🔍 Project Abstract:
Excited to share a sneak peek into my immersive SQL-driven Pharma Data Analysis project, a pivotal task undertaken during my internship with PSYLIQ. This venture not only blends the precision of data analysis but also opens doors to the profound intersection of healthcare and analytics. As a B.PHARMACY graduate passionate about data analytics, this internship is a golden opportunity to leverage my skills and broaden my horizons.

💡 Project Overview:
In this exploration, we delve into a rich dataset encompassing critical elements such as Pharma_data (Distributor, Customer_Name, City, Country, Latitude, Longitude, Channel, Sub-channel, Product Name, Product_Class, Quantity, Price, Sales, Month, Year, Name_of_Sales_Rep, Manager, Sales_Team). This real-world dataset mirrors the complexities of healthcare data, providing a robust platform to hone SQL skills and gain insights into the dynamics of pharmaceutical sales.

📊 Key Objectives:

    Comprehensive Analysis: Uncover patterns and trends within the pharmaceutical sales landscape by conducting a thorough SQL-driven analysis.
    Country and Sub-Channel Breakdown: Explore the performance metrics of different countries and sub-channels, identifying key factors that drive success.
    Year-over-Year Growth: Analyze sales data to calculate year-over-year growth rates, offering valuable insights into industry trends.
    Top Performers Recognition: Identify top-performing countries for each sub-channel, shedding light on strategies that lead to success.
    Strategic Adaptation: Pinpoint the lowest sales months, enabling stakeholders to adapt strategies and optimize resources effectively.

🛠️ Why SQL Matters:
SQL serves as the backbone of this project, empowering me to query, analyze, and visualize complex datasets. The ability to unravel insights from raw data is crucial in making informed decisions in the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare analytics.

🚀 Join the Journey:
Embark on this data-driven journey with me as we uncover the stories within the numbers and contribute to the evolving field of healthcare analytics. Stay tuned for the complete analysis and insights!
